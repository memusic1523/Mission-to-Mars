# Summary
In conclusion, we were able to scrape data from two different web browsers. First web brower, we were able to scrape the article's title and preview text to put it in a dictionary. For the second web browser, we were able to scrape data to generate how many months exist in Mars. Within the graph at the peaks, we observe that it take 24 months until the next peak. With that were able to calculate the martian days which is 687 by obervating the next graph. The average temperature is approx. -76 degrees. We were also able to generate the which month has the lowest and highes atmospheric pressure the 6th month is the lowest and 9th month is the highest. Lastly, we were able to figure out the terrestrial day that exist in a martian year.
