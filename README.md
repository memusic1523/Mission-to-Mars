Systems: Python, Jupyter Notebook, CSV, Web Browser

# Overview
We are web scraping data to get climate information about Mars.

  - Able to scrape the title and preview text of article.
  - Able to scrape information data about Mars from a web browser.
  - Generate the amount of Martian days exist in the scrape data.
  - Generate the coldest and warmest months on Mars.
  - Generate which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure.
  - Generate how many terrestrial days exist in a martian year.
  
# Summary
In conclusion, we were able to scrape data from two different web browsers. First web browser, we were able to scrape the article's title and preview text to put it in a dictionary. For the second web browser, we were able to scrape data to generate how many months exist on Mars. Within the graph of the peaks, we observe that it takes 24 months until the next peak. With that were able to calculate the martian days which is 687 by observing the next graph. The average temperature is approx. -76 degrees. We were also able to generate which month has the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure the 6th month is the lowest and the 9th month is the highest. Lastly, we were able to figure out the terrestrial day that exists in a martian year.
